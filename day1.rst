 2021-02-01 - Day 1 (Monday)
=============================

New hire orientation, nothing new.

Apple and Macs and iphones.. oh my. Got virtualbox with ubuntu 20.10 up.

Need to setup separate github account, aws
account, postman account.

Need to find some better blogging solutions, but everything is github
based and only blogging solution is based on the public
<username>.github.io sites, which wont work for what is essentially
internal documentation. This might not be suitable if not searchable,
but at least they can be easily transferred.

aws is set up: https://dotorg.awsapps.com/start#/

github is set up: https://github.com/dotorg-lp

Meeting with Ali about roadmap. Extremly pared down vision for April,
which is good. CRM component mostly done. No analytics, no
integrations, only preliminary requirement docs (where are they)? Will
send later.

**Other Documentation**:

* `environment script to follow <https://github.com/dotorg-tech/planning/wiki/Local-Environment-(WIP)#dependencies>`_
